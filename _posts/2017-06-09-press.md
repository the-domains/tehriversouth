[The Rogue Valley Messenger][0]

> The one sentence review is that the entire EP is nice music perfectly suited for a booming harvest fest/winery tour/farmer's market scene.

> From the small, rustic town of Ashland, Oregon comes the melody-heavy roots rock of the band The River South. Employing soft melodies, slick guitars, a bit of spit and grit, and clear influences from folk, country, blues and Americana (thus, roots rock), founder, guitarist, and singer/songwriter Krister Axel's new single, "Holland Park Road," echoes recent personal struggles and two decades of working in the DIY music scene.
> "As a songwriter, I strive to capture my own observations and feelings with as much authenticity as possible, given the limitations of the English language and the 12-tone scale," Axel says. "As a trio, we play all original music in a melodic roots rock vein. The River South is a culmination of many long years of songwriting sessions, studio work, and touring."
> He moved to Ashland from California a few years ago with his guitar and a handful of songs that he had been working and which are now available on the band's self-titled debut EP. Some of his biggest musical influences include Ollabelle, Ryan Adams, JJ Cale, Martin Sexton, and Josh Ritter.
> The band, which also includes Jinnee Joos on vocals and Michael Zuzel on bass, has performed throughout the larger region encompassing southern Oregon and northern California; some of the beautiful country -- for hundreds of miles in every direction in the United States, and music that is fit for the rugged, wooded lifestyle of the Pacific Northwest.

> The River South. The iconic shuffle-snare is employed to great effect here, providing the backbone for a delicate love song. The keyboards, bass, and dual vocals fill in the warm, comforting vibe.
